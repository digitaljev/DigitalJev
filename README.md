<h2>Version History</h2>

<p>
<h3>V1</h3> Created a WordPress site using a generic template. It was had blogging functionality. However, I realised that I didn't have the time to focus on making quality posts and I wanted to focus more on project creation.
</p>
<p>
<h3>V2</h3> With addtional web development knowledge I was able to select, edit, and develop a new WordPress site built on a different template. This site was slow, and was still using templates so I wanted to improve the site more.

<h3>V3</h3>
<strong>3.0 -</strong> Current site. Got a new domain name: DigitalJev. Started marketing the brand of DigitalJev via twitter and twitch. Created the actually site using bootstrap framework. I've tailored the site to suit my needs perfectly at this time. However there is scope for improvement when I have more web and game projects under my belt.
